## 73xx Motion Controller Custom Device ##

The **NI 73xx Motion Controller Custom Device** for NI VeriStand enables users to use NI 73xx motion control boards with NI VeriStand. Users can set the motion controller's operational mode to Absolute Position, Relative Position, and Velocity control for multiple motion boards and axes.  

In velocity control mode, the velocity can be controlled in RPMs. In the position control modes, the target position can be set while supplying a maximum velocity for movement. Additionally, the current position and velocity can be read back from the motion controller.  All other motion settings and parameters are set through Measurement & Automation Explorer.
